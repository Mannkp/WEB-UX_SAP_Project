        Introducing HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

        Overview
    </h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was developed in 1990 by web founder, Tim Berners-Lee. It is a markup language. This markup language is used to describe the logical components of a text-oriented document. In web design, attempts are made to organise page structuring and text structuring according to semantic aspects. HTML enables typical elements of a text-oriented document - such as headings, text paragraphs, lists, tables, or graphic references - to be correctly delineated.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of its development, only a few HTML elements were available to the creators of web pages, which was also reflected in a corresponding simplicity of web pages. Early approaches included the insertion of images, which were also used in the form of graphic texts for headings.</p>

    <p>In recent years, internet consumption has shifted away from desktop computers to mobile devices, which can be used while travelling as well as sitting on the couch at home.</p>
        
    <p>HTML5 is the latest and most enhanced version of HTML. Technically, HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup language. In this course, we will discuss the features of HTML5 and look at how to use it in practice. HTML5 introduces a number of new elements and attributes that can help you to built modern, accessible websites.</p>

        The following is a set of some of the most prominent features introduced in HTML5:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li class="p"><strong>New Semantic Elements:</strong> These are like &ltheader&gt, &ltfooter&gt, and &ltsection&gt.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Forms 2.0:</strong> These are improvements to HTML web forms, where new attributes have been introduced for the &ltinput&gt tag.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Persistent Local Storage:</strong> To achieve without resorting to third-party plugins.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>WebSocket:</strong> A next-generation bidirectional communication technology for web applications.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Audio and Video:</strong> You can embed audio or video on your webpages without resorting to third-party plugins.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Geolocation:</strong> Now visitors can choose to share their physical location with your web application.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Drag and drop:</strong> Drag and drop the items from one location to another location on the same webpage.</li>
    </ol>
