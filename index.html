            Introducing HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
        </h1>
        <h3>
            Overview
        </h3>
        <p><b>HTML</b> (HyperText Markup Language) was developed in 1990 by web founder, Tim Berners-Lee. It is a markup language. This markup language is used to describe the logical components of a text-oriented document. In web design, attempts are made to organise page structuring and text structuring according to semantic aspects. HTML enables typical elements of a text-oriented document - such as headings, text paragraphs, lists, tables, or graphic references - to be correctly delineated.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of its development, only a few HTML elements were available to the creators of web pages, which was also reflected in a corresponding simplicity of web pages. Early approaches included the insertion of images, which were also used in the form of graphic texts for headings.</p>

        <p>In recent years, internet consumption has shifted away from desktop computers to mobile devices, which can be used while travelling as well as sitting on the couch at home.</p>
            
        <p>HTML5 is the latest and most enhanced version of HTML. Technically, HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup language. In this course, we will discuss the features of HTML5 and look at how to use it in practice. HTML5 introduces a number of new elements and attributes that can help you to built modern, accessible websites.</p>
        <h3>
            HTML
        </h3>
        <p>
            The following is a set of some of the most prominent features introduced in HTML5:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li class="p"><strong>New Semantic Elements:</strong> These are like &ltheader&gt, &ltfooter&gt, and &ltsection&gt.</li>
            <li class="p"><strong>Forms 2.0:</strong> These are improvements to HTML web forms, where new attributes have been introduced for the &ltinput&gt tag.</li>
            <li class="p"><strong>Persistent Local Storage:</strong> To achieve without resorting to third-party plugins.</li>
            <li class="p"><strong>WebSocket:</strong> A next-generation bidirectional communication technology for web applications.</li>
            <li class="p"><strong>Audio and Video:</strong> You can embed audio or video on your webpages without resorting to third-party plugins.</li>
            <li class="p"><strong>Geolocation:</strong> Now visitors can choose to share their physical location with your web application.</li>
            <li class="p"><strong>Drag and drop:</strong> Drag and drop the items from one location to another location on the same webpage.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>A reference video tutorial for HTML is linked below:</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQN-pnXPaVg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen id="video"></iframe>

        <h3>HTML Events</h3>
        <p>
            An HTML event can be something that the browser does, or something that a user performs.
            
            Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 and every HTML element contains a set of events that can trigger JavaScript Code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples of HTML events:
            <ol>
                <li class="p">An HTML web page has finished loading
                <li class="p">An HTML input field was changed
                <li class="p">An HTML button was clicked
            </ol>
        </p>
            
            <h3>Browser APIs</h3>
            <p>
                Browser APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or they can perform useful complex tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
            Here are examples of browser APIs:
            </p>
            <ol>
                
                <li class="p">The Document Object Model (DOM) API allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing, and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, and so on. You see a manifestation of this every time you see a popup window appear on a page, or some new content displayed.

                <li class="p">The querySelector() method of the document returns the first element within a document that matches the specified selector or selectors.
                    <img src="UX500_Query_Selector_scr.png" id="qselecotr_img"></img>

                <li class="p">The Geolocation API retrieves geographical information. This is how Google Maps can discern your location and plot it on a map.

                <li class="p">Third-party APIs are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the web.

                <li class="p">These are examples of third-party APIs: the Google Maps API and the OpenStreetMap API, which allow you to embed custom maps in your website.
                </ol>
                <p>
                You will learn more about this in the chapter about JavaScript.

                <h1>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                </h1>
                <h3>Units</h3>
                <p>HTML is a language that is displayed on many different devices, from smartphones to tables or notebooks and ultra-wide monitors. This means that not every font or element size can be specified by an absolute unit such as cm, mm, in (inches), or px (pixel). As well as absolute units, CSS also has relative units as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="p">em
                        <p>
                            Relative to the font size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="p">Rem
                        <p>
                            Relative to the font size of the root element (<code>&lthtml&gt</code>).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="p">Vw
                        <p>
                            Relative to 1% of the width of the browser window.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="p">Vh
                        <p>
                            Relative to 1% of the height of the browser window.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="p">%
                        <p>
                            Relative to the parent element.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>All sizes that can be specified in CSS can be specified with both absolute and relative sizes.</p>
                <div class="note">
                <h4><strong>Note:</strong></h4>
                <p>It is always recommended to use relative sizes if possible, because they require less adjustment effort when a web page is displayed on different devices.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Margin  / Padding</h3>
                <p>
                    Margin and Padding are the outer and inner distances of an element. Margin defines the distance to the next element. Padding manipulates the actual size of the element. The distance that Padding adds is also colored by, for example, the background color.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Margin and Padding are defined in the box model, which was explained in the HTML chapter.Margin and padding can be set both implicitly and explicitly on the element pages.
                </p>
            
            <h3>Text Styling</h3>
            <p>CSS provides a variety of ways to customize the appearance of text, Simple adjustments like changing the text size or adjusting the font work with the CSS instructions font-size and font-family.</p>
            <p>There are also many other options to customize text appearance, including the following:</p>
            <img src="Text styling.png" id="textstyling"></img>

            <h3>Layouts</h3>
            <p>Through the box model and the standard flow layout of HTML, as well as margin and padding, you already have a number of ways to design a web page. However, this is not always enough to make the structure and appearance of the web site exactly as you want it.</p>

            <h3>Flex Display</h3>
            <p>FlexBox is based on a container (flex container), in which several elements (flex items) are placed. Certain properties, such as alignment, are inherited by the flex items; the items are the actual flex boxes, which contain their flexibility by being inside the container.</p>
            <p>The two axes each have one direction. Usually, the main axis runs from left to right, the cross axis from top to bottom. FlexBox is described as a one-dimensional system. Elements can be arranged either in rows or in columns. This arrangement can be specified in several ways. Possible layouts include:</p>
            <p><code>justify-content</code>(main-axis) : <code>space-between</code>, <code>space-around</code>, or <code>space-evenly</code>.</p>
            <p><code>align-items</code>(other-axis) : <code>flex-end</code>, <code>flex-start</code>, or <code>center</code>.</p>
            <p>The axis will be switch with <code>flex-direction</code>, so items will also be changed from a row layout to a column layout</p>
            <p>These define the dynamic distance between all flex items. Therefore, responsive layouts can be created very quickly.</p>

            <h1>JavaScript(JS)</h1>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is usually used in websites and is then executed by the visitor's browser. Originally, in 1995, JavaScript was still called LiveScript. It was developed by Netscape.</p>

            <p>JavaScript ensures that web pages can be built dynamically and adapted to the user. Complex control queries can be programmed in JavaScript and linked to backend services to check the entries of the visitors. Extensive browser games are written in JavaScript.</p>
                
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a compact and resource-saving language. Within a host environment, JavaScript can be linked to the objects in its environment to control them programmatically.</p>
